<br>

A simple app which displays the time and date in browser. Written in HTML, minimal CSS, and pure JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks).

## Summary

The logic on this is simple, but I enjoyed trying to keep the code as lean as possible.  I also added a button that toggles the time format between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
